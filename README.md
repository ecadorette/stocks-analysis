Module 2

## VBA of Wall Street
### Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to review the performance of stocks in the form of daily volume and return rates. We started by building the code out to capture distinct tickers, total volume, and return per ticker. Then we separately made some code to format the results for easy reading.

### Results
Most stock returns plummeted in 2018, with RUN and ENPH as the only exceptions at an 80+% return rate. See results below
